VCS : Version control sytem
	
	* Manage code on client side
	* Manage code on server side
	* Version the code/application
	* Encryption
	* VCS is evolved from RCS(Revision control system)(1970-1990)
	* Features are added to RCS and formed SCM(Source code managment)
	* Encryption was missing in SCM
	* RCS didn't have client/server cofig
	* Repository sits on the server side only
	
  -> VCS is of 3 types
	1. Local VCS(1970-1985) -> To store code in single computer
	2. Centralized VCS(1985-) -> To store complete code in server
		- Latency when due to high number of connections
		- Network issues
		- Server may get crashed is concern
	3. DVCS : Distributed Version Control system
		- DVCS uses SHA for encryption
		- Linus thorward invented GIT, he also invented Linux
